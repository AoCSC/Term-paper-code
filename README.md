# Term-paper-code
This repository is for the term paper code for CS 777 Spring 2024 created by Murong Li &amp; Chuao Peng

The data resource is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# Summary of dataset:
1. The transaction amount is relatively small. The mean of all the mounts made is approximately USD 88.
2. There are no "Null" values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values.
3. Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%) of the time, while Fraud transactions occurred (0.17%) of the time in the dataframe.
4. Except for the transaction and amount, we don't know what the other columns are (due to privacy reasons). The only thing we know is that those unknown columns have already been scaled.
